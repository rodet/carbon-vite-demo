**Start coding**: `npm run dev`

**Build the app**: `npm run build`

This repo demonstrates how [Carbon](carbondesignsystem.com/)
can work with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

There are few differences with Webpack, with a simple configuration.
To get Vite to work with Carbon, you have to specify the variables
SASS file into the [Vite configuration](https://github.com/rodet/carbon-vite-demo/blob/main/vite.config.js).

That's mostly it. Have fun and enjoy playing with Vite!
